Hello! I recently graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supported as a [Craig and Galen Brown Foundation Scholar](http://www.brownfound.org/). While there, I conducted research in Clinical NLP with Dr. Bobak Mortazavi. Specifically, I worked on adverse outcome prediction and medical report generation. You can view my publications [here]({{ "/publications/" }}).

I am excited to begin a Master's degree with the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University this Fall. I am broadly interested in the applications of NLP to healthcare and social good and I'm excited to continue my research career at CMU. In the meantime, I am currently interning with Facebook Search for the summer.
