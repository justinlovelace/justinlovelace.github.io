<h3 align="center">About</h3>

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell University. I am broadly interested in the intersection of machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. I am currently working on adapting diffusion to language generation. You can view my publications [here]({{ "/publications/" }}).

I previously graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with an M.S. in Language Technologies. While there, I utilized textual information to develop knowledge graph completion models with greater robustness to sparsity under the advisement of Dr. Carolyn Ros√®. My studies were supported by Research Fellowships from the university.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Texas A&M University and received a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supported as a [Craig and Galen Brown Foundation Scholar](http://www.brownfound.org/). While there, I conducted research in Clinical NLP with Dr. Bobak Mortazavi. Specifically, I worked on mining structured information from clinical notes for adverse outcome prediction and on improving the clinical coherence of abstractive medical report generation.
