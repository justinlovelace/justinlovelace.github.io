<h3 align="center">About</h3>

I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell University, advised by Prof. Kilian Q. Weinberger. My current research focuses on applying diffusion models to language and speech generation, aiming to advance the capabilities and controllability of generative models in these domains. You can view my publications [here]({{ "/publications/" }}).

Previously, I earned an M.S. in Language Technologies from Carnegie Mellon University, where I conducted NLP research under the advisement of Dr. Carolyn Rose. I completed my undergraduate studies at Texas A&M University, where I engaged in Clinical NLP research with Dr. Bobak Mortazavi.
