Hello! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. I am excited to be conducting research on knowledge base construction with a focus on healthcare applications under the advisement of Dr. Carolyn Ros√®. You can view my publications [here]({{ "/publications/" }}).

I previously graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be supported as a [Craig and Galen Brown Foundation Scholar](http://www.brownfound.org/). While there, I conducted research in Clinical NLP with Dr. Bobak Mortazavi. Specifically, I worked on mining structured information from clinical notes for adverse outcome prediction and on improving the clinical coherence of abstractive medical report generation.
