My current research focuses on developing diffusion models for language and speech generation, aiming to advance the capabilities and controllability of generative models in these domains. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kilian Q. Weinberger](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kilian/). 

Previously, I earned my M.S. in Language Technologies from Carnegie Mellon University, where I conducted NLP research under the advisement of [Dr. Carolyn Ros√©](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/). I completed my undergraduate studies at Texas A&M University, where I engaged in Clinical NLP research with [Dr. Bobak Mortazavi](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/mortazavi-bobak.html).
