### **CS 4782: Introduction to Deep Learning** (Spring 2024)
*Role: Course Developer & Co-Instructor*

[**Course Website**](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4782/2024sp/)

As a co-instructor for the pilot offering of CS 4782, I had the opportunity to design and teach Cornell's undergraduate introduction to deep learning course.

> **Course Description:**
> This class is an introductory course to deep learning. It covers the fundamental principles behind training and inference of deep networks, deep reinforcement learning, the specific architecture design choices applicable for different data modalities, discriminative and generative settings, and the ethical and societal implications of such models.
